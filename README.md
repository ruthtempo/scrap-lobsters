IRecently I learned about web scraping and found it was a quite intereting topic. 
Here I created my own scraper function that is then used to display some data.


## Run the project

- Fork the project
- Clone the project
- Navigate to the project directory
- Install the dependencies npm install
- Run the project `npm start` 
- Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.
